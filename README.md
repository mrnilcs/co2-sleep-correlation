# 📊 Investigating the Relationship Between Indoor CO₂ Levels and Sleep Quality

This project investigates the relationship between indoor carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration during sleep and various sleep metrics as measured by the Oura ring. Elevated CO₂ levels are known to affect cognitive performance and alertness; this study explores whether similar physiological effects may influence sleep quality in a home setting.

**Research Hypothesis:**

> Elevated indoor CO₂ levels during sleep are statistically associated with measurable changes in sleep quality, as recorded by Oura metrics.

Preliminary analysis supports this hypothesis, with statistically significant correlations observed—especially with REM sleep duration, resting heart rate, and overall sleep score.

## 🎯 Research Objective

To determine whether indoor CO₂ levels during sleep correlate with Oura sleep metrics, including REM duration, sleep efficiency, and resting heart rate, among others.

### 1. CO₂ Data Collection

- CO₂ values were recorded using a Home Assistant-integrated **SCD4x sensor** running ESPHome on an M5Stack StampS3.
- Sampling intervals varied (1–60 seconds) over the study period depending on configuration.
- Data was exported from Home Assistant in CSV format via the history endpoint:
  [Sensor readings (example)](http://homeassistant.local:8123/history?entity_id=sensor.lounge_airq_co2&start_date=2024-05-31T21%3A00%3A00.000Z&end_date=2025-05-17T15%3A00%3A00.000Z)

### 2. Sleep Quality Data

- Exported manually from [Oura Cloud Trends](https://cloud.ouraring.com/trends).
- Contains nightly sleep metrics including:

  - Total Sleep Duration
  - REM Sleep Duration
  - Lowest Resting Heart Rate
  - Sleep Efficiency
  - Deep Sleep Score
  - Respiratory Rate

### 3. Data Processing Workflow

- CO₂ data filtered for the configured sleep window (22:00–07:00).
- For each night:

  - Compute average and maximum CO₂ values
  - Align timestamp with Oura morning-based sleep end date

- Datasets merged by night; inconsistent rows dropped

### 4. Analysis Techniques

- Automated scan of **all numeric Oura sleep metrics**
- Pearson correlation, linear regression (slope, r, p-value)
- Results sorted by absolute r-value (|r|) for interpretability
- Visual plots generated using `matplotlib`
- Implemented in `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy.stats`

---

## 📈 Preliminary Findings

Based on approximately 100 matched nights, elevated CO₂ levels:

- **Negatively correlate** with:

  - REM Sleep Duration
  - Total Sleep Score
  - Sleep Efficiency

- **Positively correlate** with:

  - Resting Heart Rate
  - Respiratory Rate

```

**Notes:**

- Sampling interval varies (1–60s)
- Some timestamps may be missing or malformed
- Data cleaning scripts remove non-numeric values

### `oura_trends.csv`

Exported from [Oura Cloud Trends](https://cloud.ouraring.com/trends):

```csv
date,Total Sleep Score,REM Sleep Duration,Lowest Resting Heart Rate,Awake Time,...
2023-09-17,90,5430,44,187,...
2023-09-18,85,5000,45,220,...
```

**Notes:**

- One row per night
- Data filtered to include only valid entries
- Nights may be missing due to sync issues

---

## ⚠️ Data Quality Considerations

- CO₂ and Oura timestamps are aligned using a `night_date` logic
- Sampling density of CO₂ values may vary across nights
- Partial/missing data is excluded from analysis pipeline
- Analysis includes fallback aggregation and overlap filtering
